Great to hear everything’s working! Below is a polished `README.md` file for your `ConfigSync` project. It’s designed to be clear, professional, and GitHub-friendly, showcasing what the library does, how to use it, and how to run the demo. Since your project is now complete with a runnable `Demo` console app in Visual Studio, I’ll tailor the README to reflect that setup.

# ConfigSync

A lightweight .NET Core library to synchronize configuration settings across multiple sources, ensuring consistency in your applications.

## Overview

`ConfigSync` helps developers keep app settings (like database names or port numbers) in sync between different sources, such as JSON files, environment variables, or in-memory configurations. It detects differences, logs changes, and applies updates—all with a simple, chainable API. Perfect for .NET Core projects, including backends for Next.js apps!

- **Features**:
  - Sync settings between JSON files, environment variables, and more.
  - Detect and report differences between config sources.
  - Log changes for auditing.
  - Fluent, easy-to-use interface.

- **Built With**:
  - .NET Standard 2.0
  - Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
  - Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

## Installation

Since this is a demo project, you can clone it and reference it locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ConfigSync.git
  
2. Open `ConfigSyncSolution.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution (`Ctrl+Shift+B`).

(To package this as a NuGet library later, run `dotnet pack` in the `ConfigSync` folder.)

## Usage

Here’s how to use `ConfigSync` in your .NET Core app:

```csharp
using ConfigSync;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Load the "source" configuration (the one you want to sync to)
        var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
            .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
            .Build();

        // Set up logging (optional)
        var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder => builder.AddConsole());
        var logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<Program>();

        // Sync settings from another source
        var sync = new ConfigSynchronizer(config, logger)
            .FromJson("appsettings2.json") // Load a JSON file to compare
            .Sync();                       // Apply the sync

        // Optional: Check differences
        var diffs = sync.GetDifferences();
        foreach (var diff in diffs)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Difference: {diff.Key} - {diff.Value}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Example Config Files
- `appsettings.json` (source):
  ```json
  {
    "Database": "MainDB",
    "Port": "80"
  }
  ```
- `appsettings2.json` (target):
  ```json
  {
    "Database": "TestDB",
    "Port": "8080"
  }
  ```

### Output
Running the above code will log changes and show differences:
```
info: Program[0]
      Syncing Database: From TestDB to MainDB
info: Program[0]
      Syncing Port: From 8080 to 80
Difference: Database - From TestDB to MainDB
Difference: Port - From 8080 to 80
```

## Demo

Try it out yourself with the included demo!

1. Open `ConfigSyncSolution.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. In Solution Explorer, expand `ConfigSync` and right-click `Demo` > “Set as Startup Project.”
3. Press `F5` to run.
4. Watch it sync `appsettings.json` with `appsettings2.json` included in the `Demo` folder.

The demo includes:
- `Program.cs`: Example usage of `ConfigSync`.
- `appsettings.json` and `appsettings2.json`: Sample configs to sync.
